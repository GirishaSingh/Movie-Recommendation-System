# Movie Recommendation System
A Movie Recommendation System that recommends five movies based on the movie selected by the user.
## Description
This project is built using Python, sklearn, NLTK, and pickle, with a simplistic website created using Streamlit. The dataset includes nearly 5000 movies sourced from IMDb, 
which has been processed using pandas and numpy. Tags for movies were created using this data. Using sklearn's cosine similarity metrics, vectors were created based on the tags, which are used for prediction.
## Usage
To use the Movie Recommendation System, follow these steps:
1. Start the Streamlit app:
  streamlit run app.py
2. Select a movie from the dropdown list to get recommendations.
## Demonstration
